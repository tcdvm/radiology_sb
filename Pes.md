* Composed of tarsal bones, metatarsal bones, and phalanges
* Usu look at typical views but also oblique views
* Terminology changes at level of tarsocrual joint from “cranial” to **dorsal** and from “caudal” to **plantar**

## Tarsus
* 7 individual bones
  * Talus
  * Calcaneus
  * Central tarsal bone
  * Tarsal bones 1-4
* Complicated area so visualizing everything in standards and oblique views can be complicated
* Special dorsoplantar view of tarsocrural joint with join in flexion can be useful to evaluate the medial and lateral trochlea of the talus for more accurate assessment 

### Tarsal bone #1
* Most variable, might not be present as individual bone but is fused in proximal portion of first metatarsal bone

### Dew Claw
* More commonly found in the manus and usually are removed
* Some breed standards (e.g. Beauceron) require presence of double rear dew claw - assoc with anomalous shape of central and first tarsal bones

## Cat
* Smooth projection from plantar-proximal aspect of 5th metatarsal bone not present in dogs

## Chondrodystrophic dogs
* Calcaneus appears proportionally larger
