* Compound joint between metacarpals and radius/ulna
* Comprised of cuboidal carpal bones in 2 rows and occ sesamoid bone
* Flexion occurs exclusively at antebrachiocarpal joint
* Need more views to thoroughly evaluate

* Proximal row - radial, ulnar, and accessory carpals
* Distal row - C1-C4

## Radial carpal bone
* Largest carpal bone
* Medially located
* Articulates with ulnar carpal bone laterally, distal margin articulates with all 4 carpal bones
* Tiny edge laterally sticks out and doesnâ€™t articulate with anything (not a subluxation)
* Some will have small sesamoid bone at distal medial aspect - is within tendon of abudctor pollicis longus m. (not chip fracture or joint mouse)

## Ulnar carpal bone
* Articulates with radius, ulna, lateral aspect of radial carpal bone, accessory carpal bone, 4th carpal bone, and 5th metacarpal bone


## Joints
* Antebrachiocarpal joint - has almost all of the ROM for flexion
* Intercarpal joint
* Carpometacarpal joint


* Stress radiography often needed to evaluate for soft tissue injury especially in carpus - if suspected, apply pressure to antebrachium and manus to apply tension to appropriate soft tissue structures
