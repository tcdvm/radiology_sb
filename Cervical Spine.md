# Cervical Spine

## Atlas - first vertebra
* No intervertebral disk between occipital condyles and atlas
* Accommodates flexion and extension but no lateral or rotary movement (yes joint)
* No articular processes, no spinous process
* Large transverse processes - “wings” with a lateral foramina right at the start of each wing (craniodorsally) and transverse vertebral foramina located in the wings (more caudally)
  * Vertebral artery and vein go through each formina and first cervical spinal nerve comes out lateral foramina
* Arises from 3 centers of ossification - pair of neural arches and intercentrum 1 that forms body
  * Arches fuse dorsally after 100 days (~3ish months) and the body fuses laterally in range of 110-120 days (~4 months)
  * Intercentrum 1 rarely seen but may appear as an isolated fragment when patient is obliquely positioned


## Axis - second vertebra
* Largest cervical vertebra
* Arises from 7 centers of ossification (atlas has 3) - 2 vertebral arches, centrum 2, caudal epiphysis, intercentrum 2, centrum 1, and centrum of the proatlas
  *  Centrum 1 + centrum of the proatlas => dens
  *  Centrum of the proatlas is embryologically part of the atlas
  *  Fusing occurs around 100-400 days for all the various bits
* Really large spinous process which overlaps the lamina of the atlas
* No cranial articular process but does have caudal ones --> no cranial means unobstructed view of intervertebral foramen at C1-C2 on lateral(in contrast to caudal ones where articular processes superimposed on intervertebral foramens)
* Has a dens that can be seen in VD rads but not really in lateral unless head is rotated slightly dorsal or ventrally
* Normally no flexion at atlanoaxial joint because dens is stuck to atlas with apical ligament, transverse atlantal ligament, and dorsal atlanoaxial ligament
  * Apical ligament has 3 pillars - 1 to basioccipital bone, 2 lateral ones to occipital (stronger and more robust)
* Has lateral or rotary movement at atlantoaxial joint (no joint)
  * Way to evaluate joint is to compare orientation of dorsal lamina of both --> should align in nearly linear fashion
  * Note that overlap of C2 spinous process over C1 is not good indicator since can vary a lot between subjects
* Radiograph gotcha’s:
  * Occassionally may see radiolucent line in vertebral arch of mature does - just a vascular channel, not a fracture
  * Also, can see very heterogenous coarse bone in vertebral arch of C2 - also not pathologic (could be geriatric osteopenia?)
  * Caudal aspect of vertebral arch that forms dorsal aspect of the articular process joint between C2-C3 is often irregular - may be misinterpreted as new bone formation but isn’t

## Spinal Nerves
* Typically designated by corresponding vertebral at cranial aspect of junction 
* Cervical cranial nerves slightly different
  * First cervical spinal nerve exits at lateral foramen of atlas (even before C1-C2 articulation)
  * Second cervical spinal nerve therefore exits between C1-C2 and so on (so Cn is out of Cn-1-Cn)
  * So although 7 cervical vertebrae, there’s 8 cervical spinal nerves in contrast to thoracic and lumbar spine where number of spinal nerves is equal to number of vertebrae

## 3, 4, 5 Cervical Vertebrae
* Similar to one another, devoid of any distinguishing features
* Each has transverse foramen through each pedicle through which vertebral artery passes
* Has large cranial articular processes that obscure (but not all the way) intervertebral foramen on lateral --> can’t see at C3-4 through to C6-7, can see C2-3 because cranial articular process is a little smaller

# 6th Cervical Vertebra
* Has slightly larger spinous process compared to C3,4,5 and *very* prominent/large transverse processes
* Transverse process is good landmark if limited view rads are provided
* Also has transverse foramen for vertebral artery

# 7th Cervical Vertebra
* Similar to C3-5 but has larger spinous process and no transverse foramen because verebral artery is ventral to body 

## Block Vertebrae
* Occurs from failure of embryologic separation, usually involving 2 but 3 vertebrae has been reported
* Usu cranial or mid cervical
* IVdisc between fused vertebrae are usually dinky and may just be small vertical radiolucent line
* Width is usually less than typical
* Altered biomechanics can lead to degenerative vertebral and disc
* disease adjacent to it but no issues by itself

# Transitional Anomalies
* Seen most often in transitional zones e.g. from cervical to thoracic
* Most common is cervical to thoracic where C7 will have a little rib
* Cervical ribs may be small and isolated or extend out to articulate with first thoracic rib; usually malformed
* Cervical ribs have no clinical significance

# Misc details about cervical spine
* Caudal cervical spine - transverse foramina are large but cannot be seen distinctly because is overlaped by dense bone of body/pedicle - In summation will appear to be more radiolucent but isn’t pathologic (not an aggressive bone lysis situation)

# Cats vs Dogs
* Cervical spine in cats - usually blockier (rectangular) with more coarse trabeculae
* Transverse processes of C6 are more lateral projecting (vs ventral in dogs)
* Transverse processes of C4-6 less distinct than dog and may be misinterpreted as new bone formation from ventral asepct
