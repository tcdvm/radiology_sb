* Diaphragmatic crura are usually parallel with the right crus more cranial than the left usually
* Usually more heart to sternal contact
* Right cranial lobar artery and vein typically more dorsal than left lateral and become superimposed on left cranial pulmonary artery
  * Effect of becoming more cranial is from dependent lung being compressed so that it moves dorsally
  * Not just normal structures but also pathology also displaces dorsally
  * Condition also occurs in left lateral, called *down pathology rises* phenomenon (can be significant shift)
* Vessels to the caudal part of left cranial lobe and cranioventral vessels of left caudal lobe usually visible overlapping caudal aspect of cardiac sillouette
