# Sacrum
* Composed of 3 fused segments
* Fused to ilium (sacroiliac junction) to connect spine to pelvis and pelvic limbs

## Congenital abnormalities
* Incomplete fusion of individual segments
* Sacrocaudal transitional vertebrae
* Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae

## Gotchas
* On lateral, articulation between sacrum and ilium sometimes can cause an ill-defined opacity ventrally --> **not** hyperostotic sacral lesion
* Pelvic surface of sarcram can be pretty bumpy, can look like the ventral edges don’t line up (may look like a fracture) but isn’t
* Poop and gas in cecum can cause lucent lines that might look like fractures but aren’t

# Cats
* Manx cats can have absence of portion of sacrum as well as other vertebral anomalies --> can lead to fecal retention or impaction
* Cats can have a caudoventral protuberance from the ventral aspect of sacrum - might look like a callous but is variant of normal

# Caudal Spine
* Number varies by breed and whether the tail has been docked
* Vertebral arch is present only on first few caudal vertebrae and then slowly gets less and less caudally
* Ventrally, has hemal arches which are separate bones that articulate with cranioventral aspects of Cd4-6 - helps to protect median caudal artery
* Articular processes also start to disappear caudally so that by Cd12 they’re gone and eventually vertebrae just turn to “rods”
* Most common malformation is hemivertebrae which causes the “screw tail”
* Cats: No unique anatomic features different from dogs
