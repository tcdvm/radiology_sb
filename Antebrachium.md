## Summary of what connects where
* Extends from elbow joint down to carpus, consists of radius and ulna
* Radius starts out lateral to ulna at elbow and then is medially at carpus
* Radial head interdigitates with radial notch of ulna
  * Distally at carpus, styloid process of ulta abuts with laterodistal aspect of radius

## Interosseous Ligament
* Important interosseous ligament (joins radius and ulna together) present at proximal third of radius (near nutrient foramen)
    * May be where force from radius at antebrchiocarpal joint is transmitted to ulna
    * Common to see irregular cortical margin at this site - may make it harder to assess disease at this site
 
## Growth Plates
* Radius
  * Proximal and distal physes - most growth comes from distal (70%) and a little from proximal (30%)
  * Proximal closes around 7-10 months
  * Distal closes around 10-12 months
* Ulna
  * Most lengthening past elbow is from distal physis which has to coordinate growth with the radius (70+30 radial = 100 distal ulnar)
  * V-shaped or conical growth plate may be more predisposed to problems with concussion
 
* During rapid growth, esp in large breeds, can have very irregular appearance (*cutback zone*)

* Chondrodystrophic dogs have bowed out radius and mild valgus deformity of manus; may be associated with asynchronous growth of radius vs ulna

* 🐈 bones are straighter, larger distal ulna that is lateral and like dog, doesn’t contribute to weight-bearing; growth plate is nice and horizontal unlike dog (v-shaped)
* 🐈 distal ulna more bulbous and rounded,m can also have a small radiolucent region in distal ulna, not aggressive lesion

## Carpal Pad
* Palmar to carpus, soft tissue opacity that is superimposed on bones - can look like a fracture
* Also marked reduction in soft tissue volume proximal to antebrachiocarpal joint -> can look like destruccture process at lateral aspect of radius and ditsal medial aspect of ulna
