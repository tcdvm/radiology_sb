* Unique - 3 long bones must grow perfectly together to ensure normal joint conformation
* Standard radiographic view is with brachium and antebrachium at 90 degrees from each other for the lateral (neutral and flexed) and cr-cd view

* Humerus distally - 2 condyles (medial and lateral)
  * Lateral condyle articulates with *radius* (which then goes *medially* at carpus)
  * Position of olecranon process can’t be used to localize lateral vs medial because it sits mostly midline
  * In cranial-caudal view, a little bit of the radius sticks out laterally (see above) which is normal (not a subluxation)
  * Medially, the ulna sits in the *olecranon fossa* of humerus with its *anconeal process*
    * Olecranon fossa is contiguous with radial fossa cranially via *supratrochlear foramen*
  * Orthopedic disease of the young can affect medial condyle of humerus - best way to see it is Cr15M-CdMO
  * Also can have non-fusion of medial and lateral condyles of humerus - should expect closure by 12 weeks, if present longer than that - abnormal (incomplete ossification) --> ideally have medullary cavity of ulna over this area to better see it, if can’t, then can do Cr15M-CdLO
   
  * 🐈 humerus distally also has *supracondylar foramen* through which brachial artery goes through; also has **no** supratrochlear foramen (whaaa? so weird)

  * Anconeal process is best seen in fully flexed lateral to avoid superimposition with medial epicondyle of humerus
    * Contour of process can vary by breed which makes judging early remodeling harder
    * A. Process remodeling is one of the earliest sign of OA
    * Some large breed dogs will have separate ossification center which is *different* than Ununited Anconeal Process (UAP) - is unrelated to presence of an anconeal ossification center
 
  * Medial coronoid process is usually superimposed over radius which prevents good evaluation of this process --> creates curved triangular opacity
    * Need good radiographic technique to see triangular opacity
    * Joint congruency better evaluated on Cr-Cd view where medial coronoid process is sharp shelf of bone subjacent to medial humeral condyle
    * Condrodystrophic breeds have smaller medial coronoid processes (most apparent on lateral)
    * Physes of distal humeral condyle and medial epicondyle can complicate radiographic interpretation in young patient (usually closed up to 7-8 months of age)
   
  * Triceps muscles originate from caudal aspects of scapula and humerus and attaches to olecranon process of ulna
    * Olecranon process extends proximally to trochlear notch and typically has 2 rounded protruberances at most proximal-cranial margin --> not to be confused with enthesophytes
   
  * Infrequently, seasmoid bone present in supinator muscle at craniolateral aspect of proximal radius - not an avulsion fragment or joint mouse (can also see in cats - most often in lateral view)
