* Consists of metacarpals (5) and digits (usu 4) with 3 phalanges
* Variable presence of first digit (dewclaw) and associated first metacarpal (either hypoplastic or removed)
* Metacarpophalangeal joints 2-5 all have 2 sesamoid bones at palmar aspect and 1 sesamoid bone at dorsal aspect
  * Palmar sesamoid bones are numbers #1-8 (medial to lateral)
  * Sometimes sesamoid boneis multpartite (particularly #2 & 7) -> can result in lameness in some patients
 
* Metacarpal pad is under the metacarpophalangeal joints
  * Shape can result in a linear oblique radiolucencies over the digits (not a fracture)

* Metacarpal bones
  * Has base proximally and head distally
  * Head articulates with base of associated proximal phalanx
  * Visible physis on *distal* aspect of MC2-5 that closes approximately 6-7 months (no physis at proximal aspect)
 
* Phalanges
  * Proximal and middle have 1) base 2) body 3) trochlea
  * Distal has base proximally and ungual process process and associated unguis (nail) distally
  * Superimposition of digits can be alleviated with traction
