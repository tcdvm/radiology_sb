Most common views are lateral and cr-cd

# Femur
## Femoral head
* Articulates with acetabulum to form coxofemoral joint
* Mostly round except for depression (_fovea capitis_) where the _ligament of the head of the femur_ (aka round ligament) comes out of and goes to acetabular fossa
  * Can appear as a region of decreased opacity if not struck tangentially
  * Flattening of head from _fovea capitis_ is not consequence of joint incongruity -> can occur but is located more proximally at weight-bearing aspect of the femoral head and not medially where fovea capitis is
* Femoral head originates from separate center of ossification, _capital epiphysis_; should be fused by 1 year of age joining head with neck -> may have thin radiopaque line throughout life at site of closed physis

## Greater Trochanter
* Lateral to femoral head and neck
* Has a depression between head and trochanter called *trochanteric fossa*
* Muscles that attach here
   1. Gluteus medius
   2. Gluteus profundus
   3. Piriformis
* Has separate ossification center that can be seen in young dogs - should close from 9-12 months of age

## Lesser Trochanter
* Smaller protuberance on proximal aspect of femur located at medial aspect and distal to greater trochanter
* Size is more variable
* Iliopsoas attaches here
* Also has separate ossification center - can look isolated and be confused for a fracture
* Should close at 9-12 months of age

### Nutrient Canal
* Large artery goes through caudal cortex in proximal diaphysis
* Laterally, can look like fracture
* Cr-Cd views can look like focal lysis surrounded by region of increased opacity

## Distal Femur
* Medial and lateral condyle which articulate with tibia, with interposed menisci to form *stifle* joint
* At each condyle cranially is a ridge anteriomedially that forms groove between condyles called *intercondylar fossa* -> many vessels enter femur here and create an area of lucency (**not** lysis)
* Concave depression at lateral cranial aspect of lateral condyle is attachment point for origin of the *long digital extensor* called the *extensor fossa*
  * Can be confused with osteochondrosis lesion
  * Can become more conspicuous radiographically in dogs with arthritis due to new bone formation at periphery of fossa
* Femoral condyles originate from different centers of ossification and distal femoral physis visible in dogs younger than 1 year
* In young dogs, can have a lot of irregular margins around patella and femoral condyles, joint space can appear widened (from thicker articular cartilages)

## Sesamoid Bones (4)
### 1. Patella
* 4 seasmoid bones associated with stifle joint, largest is *patella*
* Patella is insertion point of quadriceps femoris which continues over as a patellar ligament
* Position of patella in lateral view depends on amount of flexion
* In Cr-Cd view, should be positioned over and centered over femoral trochlea
* Distal end of patella may have irregular edge, shouldn‚Äôt be confused for geographic lysis

### 2 & 3. Medial & Lateral Gastrocnemius Fabellae
* Each head of gastroc has a fabellae with the lateral one being slightly bigger than medial
* Medial one is occ more distal, common variant in Westies (70% of examined dogs vs 9% in other small breeds, rarely in large breeds)
* Can also have multipartite or fragmented of either one, not clinically significant
* Finally medial one can be absent and is not clinically significant

### 4. Popliteal sesamoid bone
* Lies in tendon of popliteus muscle
* Not present in every patient, if missing no big deal
* Sometimes can only be seen in lateral view bc of imposition on cr-cd views

## Infrapatellar Fat Pad
* Sits behind patellar ligament
* Visible as radiolucent structure bounded by stifle and associated bones
* Extracapsular to the stifle joint -> can appear displaced cranially if there‚Äôs swelling or mass within the joint

## Extracapsular fascial stripe
* Caudal to stifle, can be pushed caudally or curved same as infrapatellar fat pad with any joint swelling

## Medial & Lateral Menisci
* Cannot be evaluated radiographically - contribute to soft tissue opacity but so much imposition and not large enough to evaluate on radiographs

## Chondrodystrophic Breed Changes
* Femur is shorter with larger protuberances (e.g. greater & lesser trochanter)
* Femoral head is larger than neck which can give a weird appearance but is not osteophyte formation
* Femoral condyles are also larger and the femur at this end is more curved with caudal displacement of femoral condyles

## Popliteal Lymphocenter
* With improvements in contrast resolution, can now see this in lateral rads - usu one LN but sometimes can have more than 1

üêà
* Femur is similar to dogs, but more linear and lesser trochanter is a little larger
* 2 major differences in stifle joint
  * Feline patella is tapered and longer distal end
  * Small mineralized foci cranial aspect of the joint in lateral in 37% of cats - could represent regions of ossification of medial meniscus - clinically insignificant when small, when larger associated with cartilage erosion - called *meniscal ossicles*
