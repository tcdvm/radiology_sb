Most common views are lateral and cr-cd

# Femur
## Femoral head
* Articulates with acetabulum to form coxofemoral joint
* Mostly round except for depression (_fovea capitis_) where the _ligament of the head of the femur_ (aka round ligament) comes out of and goes to acetabular fossa
  * Can appear as a region of decreased opacity if not struck tangentially
  * Flattening of head from _fovea capitis_ is not consequence of joint incongruity -> can occur but is located more proximally at weight-bearing aspect of the femoral head and not medially where fovea capitis is
* Femoral head originates from separate center of ossification, _capital epiphysis_; should be fused by 1 year of age joining head with neck -> may have thin radiopaque line throughout life at site of closed physis

## Greater Trochanter
* Lateral to femoral head and neck
* Has a depression between head and trochanter called *trochanteric fossa*
* Muscles that attach here
   1. Gluteus medius
   2. Gluteus profundus
   3. Piriformis
* Has separate ossification center that can be seen in young dogs - should close from 9-12 months of age

## Lesser Trochanter
* Smaller protuberance on proximal aspect of femur located at medial aspect and distal to greater trochanter
* Size is more variable
* Iliopsoas attaches here
* Also has separate ossification center - can look isolated and be confused for a fracture
* Should close at 9-12 months of age

### Nutrient Canal
* Large artery goes through caudal cortex in proximal diaphysis
* Laterally, can look like fracture
* Cr-Cd views can look like focal lysis surrounded by region of increased opacity

## Distal Femur
* Medial and lateral condyle which articulate with tibia, with interposed menisci to form *stifle* joint
