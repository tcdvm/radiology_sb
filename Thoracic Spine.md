* 13 vertebrae in normal spine with paired ribs on each side that articulate cranially with spine
* Heads of first ribs are more lobulated and can be misinterpreted as new bone formation
* Height of spinous process decreases and angles back the more caudally you go
  * At one point spinous process is more or less vertical -- called the *anticlinal vertebra*; usually T11 in big dogs and T10 in small dogs --> good for landmark
 
* From midthoracic region caudally, vertebrae start to have “accessory processes” from the caudal pedicle --> usually not visible bc of superimposition from ribs

* Transitional anomalies common at thoracolumbar junction which usually include weird T13 ribs - either missing, hypoplastic or malformed - can look like weird transverse processes
  * Clinically important when using last rib as a landmark for needle aspirate or hemilam

## Hemivertebrae
* Congenital vertebral anomaly most common in thoracic spine of Bulldog, Frenchie, Boston, Pug
* Wedge-shaped vertebra - when bad can have other effects such as clinical signs of thoracic spinal cord compression, but can be also incidental
* Usually looks more narrow from the lateral view, and can be butterfly shaped on the VD views
* Most common location is T7, 8, 12 - usu can have dorsal deviation called *kyphosis* with other neighboring vertebrae changing position as a result too
* If there’s more than one adjacent hemivertebrae, ribs get closer too (looks crowded)

Cat vs Dog
* Cat has no unique anatomic features not described in dog but ribs don’t extend as far dorsally which allows for better view of intervertebral foramina and accessory processes of caudal thoracic vertebrae
