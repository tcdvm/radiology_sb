* Cranial-caudal limits of lateral radiographics
  * Cranial to manubrium to at least one to two vertebral body lengths
  * Dorsoventrally, entire limits of thoracic cavity
  * Dorsal rib heads should be superimposed - might need to elevate sternum unless brachycephalic then may need opposite
  * Forelimbs pulled cranially and head and neck extended a little
  * Central axis of beam should be centered just caudal to the caudal scapula in dogs and 1 inch caudal to that in cats
* Radiographs should be taken at peak inspiration and if possible without sedation because sedation decreases lung aeration with increased pulmonary opacity, if not at peak inspiration can look very different
* In lateral, skeletal and soft tissue structures cranial to the heart should be visible - easier in digital systems with superior image processing

* Because of movement, want to optimize for fast shot - high mA output (with minimal exposure time) - high kVP, low mAs
* Minimum of 3 views needed
  * Both laterals needed because dependent lung has some normal physiologic atelectasis which results in disease being obscured
* Usually just need either VD or DV but sometimes DV better for dorsal pulmonary lesions and VD better for acessory pulmonary lobe and ventral disease
