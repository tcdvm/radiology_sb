* The ‚Äúcrus‚Äù
* Lateral and cr-cd views are most common like femur and stifle

# Tibia
* Proximal surface is relatively flat and articulates with meniscii with *medial and lateral condyles*
* Between condyles is intercondylar eminence composed of *medial and lateral intercondylar tubercles*
* Tibial condyles arise from separate center of ossification, *proximal tibial epiphysis*

## Tibial tuberosity
* Where quadraceps femoris, parts of biceps femoris, and sartorius muscles insert
* Arises from separate ossification center
* Surrounded by cartilage in young dogs (not avulsion when viewed on radiographs!)
* Incompletely united tibia creates a circular opacity in Cr-Cd of the stifle joint (in contrast to the radiolucency described below)
* Some mature dogs with normal tibial tuberosity will have a focal radiolucency in proximal-cranial aspect of the tuberosity
  * Prevalence is about 21% in one survey and histologically found to be hyaline cartilage core
  * More common in toy, small, and medium breeds  & dogs with it were more likely to have medial patellar luxation but cause & effect unknown
  * Is **not** an aggressive bone lesion but as above, can be more disposed to medial patellar luxation

## Nutrient Canal
* Caudal aspect of tibial cortex has a nutrient canal at approximately the middle of the diaphysis and is located laterally
* Best seen in Cr-Cd view
* In lateral view fibula can be superimposed on tibia - when 2 structures cross each other, artifactual change created at margin called *mach effect* where it can look like a black line at the edge of the overlapping tibial and fibular cortices - looks like a fracture or as the nutrient foramen

## Distal Tibia
* Articulates with talus at medial and lateral *cochleae*
* Has medial and lateral *malleolus* too which stabilizes tarsocrual joint
* Fibula articulates with caudal aspect of lateral tibial condyle and extends distally to end of lateral malleolus

üêà 
* Crus has same morphologic features more or less but fibula tends to articulate further distally on lateral tibial condyle 
* Lateral malleolus has smooth lateral osseous protruberance not found in the dog
