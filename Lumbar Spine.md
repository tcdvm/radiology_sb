* 7 lumbar vertebrae
* Accessory process can be seen on lateral of cranial ones
* Ventral body of L3 & 4 can be kind of hazy, don’t misinterpret as aggressive process
* Can see intervertebral foramina easily on lateral views
* Occ can see “8” vertebrae but it’s rare and more likely to be missing T13 ribs; need full thoracic spine to confirm
  * If really 8, no clinical significance
* Some dogs can have a much shorter L7, no big deal

## Cats vs Dogs
* No big differences but cats can have longer ones and longer transverse processes
 
## Lumbosacral joint
* Small amount of flexion and extension is normal - hard to quantify how much is too much or little though
* Lumbosacral area can have transitional weirdness
  * *Sacralization* of L7 most common where one side is “normal” and other side is fused to ilium
  * Pelvic asymmetry can lead to difficulties get a perfect VD shot with pelvic limbs in extension
  * Sacralization can increase likelihood of developing cauda equina syndrome
