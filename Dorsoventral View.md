* Patient is in sternal recumbency - sometimes hard to position in dogs with hip OA
* Diaphragm is domed and extends more cranially than VD as a result of abdominal pressure
  * More physical contact of heart with diaphragm and can shift heart to the left (is *not* cardiomegaly); occurs more often in big dogs
* Caudal lobar pulmonary vessels - more conspicuous in DV view than VD
  * Vessels are more perpendicular to x-ray beam = less distortion and little atelectasis in dorsal
  * Veins are more medial, arteries lateral
  * Often right caudal lobar vein is superimposed over caudal vena cava making assessment of either harder
  * Normal caudal pulmonary artery & vein should b earound the same size; in absolute terms about the size of 9th rib at intersection (should form a square â¬œ at the intersection) - this is just an approximation though
