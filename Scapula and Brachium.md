# The Scapula and Brachium
* Scapula - largest bone in the shoulder, varies in position with respect to spinal cord a whole lot
* Distal parts - acromion, scapular notch, shoulder joint, supraglenoid tubercle (where biceps attaches), coracoid process
* Infrequently have incomplete ossification at distal aspect of canine acromion
* 🐈: coracoid process more developed than dog, acromion has hamate process and suprahamate process
  * May have separate ossification center at caudal aspect of glenoid cavity which can be hard to differeniate from an osteophyte
* Clavicle in dog is rudimentary, might only been seen on VD/DV in body of brachiocephalicus
  * 🐈has much more developed clavicle and can be seen in both lateral or VD, could be confused with eosphageal FB if poorly positioned
* When radiographing, tendency to abduct limb which can make it seem like medial joint is disrupted
* Lateral rads are best taken with limb of interest closest to the film/sensor with head extended dorsally and other limb caudally
* To get Cr-Cd view, have animal on dorsal and extend limb cranially
* To get lateral and oblique views WITHOUT spine, hard to do but can put in lateral with limb of interest uppermost, flex head and neck with elbow directed dorsally to force scapula dorsal to the cranial aspect of the thoracic spine - get slightly oblique view but no spine superimposition
* Shoulder lameness is common so lateral of shoulder is commonly shot but sometimes limb isn’t pulled cranioventrally enough and there’s superimposition of head of humerus with manubrium
* Biceps tendon originates from supraglenoid tubercle and extends laterally next to greater tubercle and smaller medially lesser tubercle
  * Cranioproximal-craniodistal oblique view to see the greater and lesser tubercles -> assess for secondary changes from bicipital tenosynovitis
* Sometimes ill-defined lucency noted at base of greater tubercle; unknown precisely what it is but questionable (probably none) clinical significance
* Greater and lesser tubercles and humeral head together make up proximal humeral epiphysis

## Osteochondrosis
* Common in canine shoulder
* Can be seen with traditional lateral but sometimes slightly medial to true caudal aspect of humerus and is not seen on lateral
* Can see caudolateral or caudomedial aspect of humerus by rotating forelimb medially or laterally (respectfully)
