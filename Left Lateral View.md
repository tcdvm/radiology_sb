* Diaphragmatic crura diverge dorsally with left crus *usually* being more cranial than right (crura are **not** parallel like in right lateral)
* Left crus cranial because pressure from abdominal organs and decreased aeration on dependent left lung
* Right crus (caudal crus) confluence with caudal vena cava
* Less heart-to-sternal contact compared to right lateral

* Pulmonary vessels arranged in artery-bronchus-vein pattern with artery dorsal and vein ventral (bronchus in the middle)
* Right cranial lung lobe artery-pulmonary-vein usu easiest to identify (ventral to left cranial lobe pulmonary vessels)
* Pulmonary vessels should be evaluated relative to each other and absolute size
* Cranial lobe vessels are usually equal in size to width of the 4th rib at the *narrowest* point

* Bronchus size can*not* be assumed from distance between artery & vein, can really only see it if it’s mineralized which obviously doesn’t happen with every patient

* Right lung is non-dependent lung and hence not affected by abdominal pressure and is better aerated -> optimizes visualization of lesions in the right lung
* Vessels on heart are usually right middle lobe’s pulmonary artery and vein (not coronary vessels which can’t be seen without contrast or unless they’re mineralized since they’re effaced by cardiac muscles)

* The better the aeration of the lungs, the more conspicuous pulmonary vessels and other parenchymal structures become
